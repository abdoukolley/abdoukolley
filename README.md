# Hello, I'm Abdou 👋

## Junior Software Engineer | Junior DevOps Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a software engineer with a diverse skill set, specializing in front-end development with programs such as React (JavaScript), HTML and CSS. 
Furthermore, I have picked up skills in DevOps through an intensive bootcamp where I gained skills in Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes and implementing Azure.

After various courses, bootcamps and watching hours of the coding university YouTube, I am ready to start my journey in the software engineering world! 😁
