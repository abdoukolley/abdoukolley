# Hello, I'm Abdou 👋

## Junior Software Engineer | Junior DevOps Engineer

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a software engineer with a diverse skill set, specializing in front-end development with programs such as React (JavaScript), HTML and CSS. 
Furthermore, I have picked up skills in DevOps through an intensive bootcamp where I gained skills in Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes and implementing Azure.

After various courses, bootcamps and watching hours of content on the coding university we call YouTube, I am ready to start my journey in the software engineering world and become a full time coder! 😁

## 🚀 My Journey

My passion for coding started during my time at university when I started a Python course for data analytics. Furthermore, little did I know at the time that this course would lead me into the career path that I find myself in today, software engineering.
From that course onwards, I started focusing particularly towards learning various coding languages, which led to the discovery that my long-term goal would to become a full-stack software engineer!

## 💻 Technical Skills 
- Python (Django, Pygame, Matplotlib)           
- Javascript (React, Typescript, Node.js, Express, Redux)
- HTML
- CSS
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Azure (Azure DevOps)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Linux
- Git

My skill set lays more towards front-end develpoment, so my plan is to strengthen my back-end skills to push me to my goal of becoming a full-stack software engineer. My next step is to to learn Next.js and further develop my skills with Typescript to become extremly strong in regards to using Javascript. 

## 🤓 Continuous Learning 
I am committed to continuous learning and constantly updating my skills to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in the software industry. I am always open to collaborating on projects or discussing new technologies and ideas.
